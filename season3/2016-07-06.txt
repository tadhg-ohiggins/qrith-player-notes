1200 gp cash
Bank of Greenfield's 3500 gp from vir Laran (redeemable in Garlathia)

interview with vir Laran

sleep at the estate

back to the fort, bringing the confiscated weapons

ask soldiers at the fort about the confiscated crossbows (arguments ensue about their origins)


Send Tara a message with a soldier from the fort:

Feast went nearly as planned. Baked a dozen, half a dozen flew. Looking for ingredients for the next recipe. Back in a week. Send bowstrings. Love, The Irregulars

Head to the abandoned fort to the east. No signs of recent habitation, but it looks like there was a fire in the fireplace within the last couple of days.

Verin casts Locate Object on the Shegan necklace, and drops it on the floor by the fireplace on the way out.

Stop by vir Laran estate again en route to Greenport.

On the 6th.

Return to Greenport to report.
