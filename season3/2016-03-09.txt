Ambushegan: How Loud Is The River

Rakas: Mike
Feroz Ka: Jeff
Kendrell: Seth
Verin: NPC

8 soldiers disguised as peasant laborers
7 soldiers in the fort
Dig a pit trap for food stores. Reinforce this during the day to allow safe movement over it, but remove the struts at night to make it an actual trap for Shegans who may try to get close enough to steal or destroy the food stores.
Verin will set magic alarms to alert us to multiple otherwise uncovered approaches
Arrange deadfall adjacent to food stores to block line-of-sight and limit viable approaches
Set soldier in tree north of food stores monitoring approaches from the river
Before nightfall, put buckets of water nearby food stores and wet blankets over food stores

Establish a watcher at fort looking out over river; another watching the watcher and looking out for a signal from the ambush site. Verin will use Dancing Lights to signal either that all but two of the soldiers at the fort should mobilize and come to aid as soon as possible or prepare the for defense if the Shegan force is overwhelming. After nightfall, 8 soldiers and the party sneak out of the fort to the ambush site. One group is north of the food stores, the other is south of it. Verin will use coded audible animal sounds to indicate to the other group which silent alarm of the four has been tripped.
