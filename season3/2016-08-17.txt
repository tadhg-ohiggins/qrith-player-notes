Burning Things

Rakas To'Ren: Mike
Feroz Ka: Jeff
Kendrell vir Militanas: Seth
Verin Ayende: NPC
Tasran Sulum: Micah

Kiatris Estate. Arrived on estate after seeing a fire to the south and Verin detecting movement of the coin in the cave to the generally vicinity of the fire (and then back again).

Party travels to homestead that had been burned.

Geezo d'Froi, Kiatris's reeve, leads us to the homestead. Geezo hasn't seen the site since the fire, himself, and has only heard reports.

Scare Geezo with stories of dangerous things in the mountains.

Stay at nearby settlement with agitated peasants.

Back to the mine. Makeshift lean-to housing a horse with hay and feed. Door added to rear entrance. Tasran toggles the bolt bolted from the inside. Feroz Ka and Kendrell carry torches. Feroz Ka opens the door. And...scene.
