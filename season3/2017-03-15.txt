Tasran Sulum: Micah

Tuesday, 21st of January

Talking to Kiatris about recent events.

Kiatris food stores raided. Guard had been subdued with a bag over his head.

Discuss boar attack, Shegan raiders, tattooed gang.

Stay night. Next morning head for Greenport. Camp by river on way back. Check for coin. Check for necklace. Attempt to magically heal Rakas.

To Greenport. Report to Tara. Tell him about battle with undead villagers and Ildis. Boar attack. Kiatris problems.

Discuss threats: Tattooed Gangs, Yersimwick, possible Shegan raid. Decide Yersimwick is the highest priority.

Rest and recuperate for a week. Check on locate object items. Coin appears near where Yersimwick used to be; between two mine sites. Necklace has not moved much past the Essryn estate.

Discussion of another locate object for an object to leave with Tara as a simple way to communicate that he needs to summon us. When it is detectable, that is a sign that he needs us back at Greenport. Or that he needs us at its location, really. Tara chooses a ceremonial dagger for this purpose.

Attempt to discern magical item abilities.

Finish healing. Head back towards the mountains, the mine. Sweep mine for any signs of visitation; none found. Head towards other mine, towards the last known location of the coin. An hour from that spot, we leave horses, and head towards higher ground for tactical advantage and vantage point. Spot a road alongside the mountain.
