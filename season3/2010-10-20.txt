Ildis Is Undead

Rakas To'Ren: Mike
Feroz Ka: Jeff
Kendrell vir Militanas: Seth
Verin Ayende: Bryce
Tasran Sulum: NPC

Wake soon after dawn, Verin locates object on the coin, finding it stationary about 8 leagues away. We follow tracks. Close to the tree line. Approaching initial location of coin, Verin refreshes and finds the coin is another league up-mountain.

Yersamuik appears on a ridge and fires a lightning bolt at Rakas. Says we should turn back; that he will not give it up.

"They couldn't use it even if they had it." When asked, said he did not kill Ildis.

Retreat to report to Tara.

Verin makes another failed attempt to heal Rakas.
